## 💡Concepts Used in This Project

* C programming language
* SysTick Timer
* Interrupts
* I/O ports
  

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim of this project is to control on board RGB LED of FRDM KL-25Z board and 4 external LEDs using 3 buttons. As default RGB LED emits red light and toggles in every 0.8s. 4 external LEDs are used as a 4-bit binary counter. At the beginning of the program, they all turned of indicating counter value to be equal to 0. Functionality of buttons are given below:  

**Button 1:** Turn RGB LED color to green. Blink 5 times.  

**Button 2:** Halt blinking of RGB LED for 2 seconds.  

**Button 3:** Increase LED counter
